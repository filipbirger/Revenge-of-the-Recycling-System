# Revenge-of-the-Recycling-System
Creation of a mechanism for depositing various containers into a recycling bin.



This project introduces principles of intelligent devices and assembly
modelling through the use of computer program design for controlling robotic devices. This allows for the creation of a mechanism for depositing various containers into a recycling bin. The following procedure will successfully classify containers using data from the physical environment, analyze the container for
contamination, and transfer the container to the correct bin for recycling.
